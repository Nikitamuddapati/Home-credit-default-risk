# Home-credit-default-risk

## Business Problem and Objective
Home Credit primarily uses traditional credit scoring methods to evaluate the repayment capacity of loan applicants. However, these conventional sources often misjudge clientsâ€™ repayment potential, leading to unjust credit denials or approvals for unsuitable candidates, increasing default rates and financial risk. The aim of this project is to accurately predict loan repayment capability for improving the loan approval process and efficiency.
